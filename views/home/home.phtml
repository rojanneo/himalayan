        <p>Dear Dog Lovers:

        We are devastated to learn the losses of so many dogs from taking the treats from China in the recent years. Our heart, prayers and solidarity are with the families who lost their dogs, the families who have dogs as their pets, and families who have pets.

        Product of highest quality and confidence should be the most essential priority of any product manufacturer. We, at Himalayan, strive to bring such products in the market, and put all efforts to ensure that none of the ingredients and packaging materials is from China. We continue to procure our products from the USA and Nepal only, as we have in the past.

        Please contact <a href="mailto:info@himalayandogchew.com">info@himalayandogchew.com</a> if you have any questions, concerns or suggestions.

        Sujan Kumar Shrestha
        Chairman & CEO</p>
